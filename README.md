> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

By observing the fibonacci sequence, we can easily conclude that the sum of the even-valued terms is *(S'-(2+1))/2+2*, where *S'* is the sum of the Fibonacci sequence up to the largest even-valued term that does not exceed four million.

> 3,5,8,&nbsp;&nbsp;13,21,34,&nbsp;&nbsp;55,89,144...

Let *F(n)* to be the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence, and *S(n)* to be the sum of the first n terms. Knowing *F(n) = F(n+2) - F(n+1)*, we can deduce that

```
S(0) = F(0)
     = F(2) - F(1)

S(1) = F(1) + F(0)
     = F(3) - F(2) + F(2) - F(1)
     = F(3) - F(1)

S(2) = F(2) + F(1) + F(0)
     = F(4) - F(3) + F(3) - F(2) + F(2) - F(1)
     = F(4) - F(1)

S(n) = F(n) + F(n-1) + ... + F(0)
     = F(n+2) - F(n+1) + F(n+1) - F(n) + ... + F(2) - F(1)
     = F(n+2) - F(1)
```

Let *F(n')* to be the largest even-valued item that does not exceed four million. The solution to this problem would be

```
S'' = (S' - (2 + 1)) / 2 + 2
    = (F(n'+2) - F(1) - (2 + 1)) / 2 + 2
```

Knowing that 'Every composite number has a prime factor less than or equal to its square root', let *n* to be the subject of factorization, we can start doing trial division within the range <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=[3,\sqrt{n}]">. Let *a* to the first factor we find, then the largest proper factor *b* would be *n / a*. Let *b* to the new *n*, iterate over the process until we fail to find a factor within the range, then *n* would be the largest prime factor.

## Problem 9: Special Pythagorean triplet
> A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, *a* < *b* < *c*, for which,
>
> *a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>*
>
> For example, 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5<sup>2</sup>.
>
> There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which *a* + *b* + *c* = 1000.
> Find the product *abc*.

Derived from **Euclid's formula**, every pythagorean triplet can be *uniquely* represented by

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a=(m^2-n^2) \cdot d, b=2mn \cdot d, c=(m^2 %2B n^2) \cdot d">

with *m* > *n* > 0, gcd(*m*, *n*) = 1, and *d* = gcd(*a*, *b*, *c*). Then we have

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=s=a %2B b %2B c=2m \cdot (m %2B n) \cdot d">

Obviously, *m*, *m*+*n*, and *d* should all be positive integers that can divide the sum of the triplet. Then the problem becomes finding the first (*m*, *m*+*n*) pair that can both divide *s*.
