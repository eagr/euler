A problem of calculating the sum of an arithmetic sequence.

By observing the fibonacci sequence, we can easily conclude that the sum of the even-valued terms is *(S'-(2+1))/2+2*, where *S'* is the sum of the Fibonacci sequence up to the largest even-valued term that does not exceed four million.

Let *F(n)* to be the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence, and *S(n)* to be the sum of the first n terms. Knowing *F(n) = F(n+2) - F(n+1)*, we can deduce that

```
S(0) = F(0)
     = F(2) - F(1)

S(1) = F(1) + F(0)
     = F(3) - F(2) + F(2) - F(1)
     = F(3) - F(1)

S(2) = F(2) + F(1) + F(0)
     = F(4) - F(3) + F(3) - F(2) + F(2) - F(1)
     = F(4) - F(1)

S(n) = F(n) + F(n-1) + ... + F(0)
     = F(n+2) - F(n+1) + F(n+1) - F(n) + ... + F(2) - F(1)
     = F(n+2) - F(1)
```

Let *F(n')* to be the largest even-valued item that does not exceed four million. The solution to this problem would be

```
S'' = (S' - (2 + 1)) / 2 + 2
    = (F(n'+2) - F(1) - (2 + 1)) / 2 + 2
```

> What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?

Knowing that 'Every composite number has a prime factor less than or equal to its square root', let *n* to be the subject of factorization, we can start doing trial division within the range <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=[3,\sqrt{n}]">. Let *a* to the first factor we find, then the largest proper factor *b* would be *n / a*. Let *b* to the new *n*, iterate over the process until we fail to find a factor within the range, then *n* would be the largest prime factor.

## Problem 4: Largest palindrome product
> A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
>
> Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Small problem size, use brute force.

## Problem 5: Smallest multiple
> 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
>
> What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
